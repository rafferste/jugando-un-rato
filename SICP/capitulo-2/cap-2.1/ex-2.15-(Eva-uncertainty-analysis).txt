-------------------------------- Exercise 2.15 ---------------------------------   
Eva Lu Ator, another user, has also noticed the different intervals computed by 
different but algebraically equivalent expressions. She says that a formula to 
compute with intervals using Alyssa's system will produce tighter error bounds 
if it can be written in such a form that no variable that represents an 
uncertain number is repeated. Thus, she says, par2 is a ``better'' program for 
parallel resistances than par1. Is she right? Why?

Tiene razon ya que toda cuenta con intervalos hace que aumente la incertidumbre,
y par1 realiza 3 cuentas entre intervalos mientra que par2 solo realiza 1
